# Robotskirt

Robotskirt is a [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) wrapper for the [Sundown](https://github.com/vmg/sundown)
library.

It was inspired by the Redcarpet gem [released by GitHub](https://github.com/blog/832-rolling-out-the-redcarpet) (the bindings to [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)).  
With the arrival of version 2 after much work, Robotskirt now mirrors every feature of Redcarpet, see below.  
It even has [additional features](#other-utilities)!

Full documentation can be found under the `doc` folder.  
Robotskirt is distributed under the **MIT license**, see `LICENSE`.

## Performance

Thanks to Sundown, Robotskirt is able to render markdown many times faster than other Markdown libraries.  
With v2, efforts have been put to make it even lighter.

Sundown is well known for its **security**, **speed** and **flexibility**.  
Robotskirt benefits from these features and tries to make the wrapping layer as thin as possible.

Robotskirt includes a small script to benchmark it against other popular markdown libraries.  
It runs the official Markdown test suite 1000 times with each item.

Results on a Thinkpad T400 running Ubuntu 12.04 and
Node 0.8.8 (currently the latest stable version):

```bash
$ node benchmark --bench
[1] robotskirt (reuse all) completed in 1354ms.
[2] robotskirt (convenience, reuse all) completed in 1353ms.
[3] robotskirt (new renderer and parser) completed in 3816ms.
[4] robotskirt (convenience, new parser) completed in 1534ms.
[5] marked completed in 3842ms.
[6] discount completed in 6025ms.
6 targets benchmarked successfully.
```

## Install

The best way to install Robotskirt is by using [NPM](https://github.com/isaacs/npm).  
If you want to install it globally, remember to use `sudo` and `-g`.

```bash
npm install robotskirt
```

**Important:** you *don't need* to have Sundown installed: Robotskirt comes bundled  
with a specific Sundown version. Just install Robotskirt as any other module.

Starting with `v2.7`, Robotskirt uses the preferred [Node-GYP](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) to compile.

## Getting started

Currently there are two ways of using Robotskirt:
[normal](#the-normal-way) and [convenience](#the-convenience-way).  
We recommend you to learn both (hey, it's just two classes!) and see the [examples](#examples).

## The Normal Way

To parse Markdown, we first need a **renderer**. It takes the parsed Markdown,  
and produces the final output (can be HTML, XHTML,
[ANSI](https://github.com/benmills/robotskirt/blob/master/examples/ansi-rend.js), plain text, ...).
