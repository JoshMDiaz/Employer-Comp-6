## Quick Example

```js
var Showdown = require('showdown');
var converter = new Showdown.converter();

converter.makeHtml('#hello markdown!');

// <h1 id="hellomarkdown">hello, markdown</h1>
```

## What's it for?

Developers can use Showdown to:

  * Add in-browser preview to existing Markdown apps

    Showdown's output is (almost always) identical to
    markdown.pl's, so the server can reproduce exactly
    the output that the user saw.  (See below for
    exceptions.)

  * Add Markdown input to programs that don't support it

    Any app that accepts HTML input can now be made to speak
    Markdown by modifying the input pages's HTML.  If your
    application lets users edit documents again later,
    then they won't have access to the original Markdown
    text.  But this should be good enough for many
    uses -- and you can do it with just a two-line
    `onsubmit` function!

  * Add Markdown input to closed-source web apps

    You can write bookmarklets or userscripts to extend
    any standard textarea on the web so that it accepts
    Markdown instead of HTML.  With a little more hacking,
    the same can probably be done with  many rich edit
    controls.

  * Build new web apps from scratch

    A Showdown front-end can send back text in Markdown,
    HTML or both, so you can trade bandwidth for server
    load to reduce your cost of operation.  If your app
    requires JavaScript, you won't need to do any
    Markdown processing on the server at all.  (For most
    uses, you'll still need to sanitize the HTML before
    showing it to other users -- but you'd need to do
    that anyway if you're allowing raw HTML in your
    Markdown.)
