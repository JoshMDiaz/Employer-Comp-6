# Markdown is broken

I have a lot of scraps of markdown engine oddities that I've collected over the
years. What you see below is slightly messy, but it's what I've managed to
cobble together to illustrate the differences between markdown engines, and
why, if there ever is a markdown specification, it has to be absolutely
thorough. There are a lot more of these little differences I have documented
elsewhere. I know I will find them lingering on my disk one day, but until
then, I'll continue to add whatever strange nonsensical things I find.

Some of these examples may only mention a particular engine compared to marked.
However, the examples with markdown.pl could easily be swapped out for
discount, upskirt, or markdown.js, and you would very easily see even more
inconsistencies.

A lot of this was written when I was very unsatisfied with the inconsistencies
between markdown engines. Please excuse the frustration noticeable in my
writing.

## Examples of markdown's "stupid" list parsing

```
$ markdown.pl

  * item1

    * item2

  text
^D
<ul>
<li><p>item1</p>

<ul>
<li>item2</li>
</ul>

<p><p>text</p></li>
</ul></p>
```


```
$ marked
  * item1

    * item2

  text
^D
<ul>
<li><p>item1</p>
<ul>
<li>item2</li>
</ul>
<p>text</p>
</li>
</ul>
```

Which looks correct to you?

```
$ markdown.pl
* hello
  > world
^D
<p><ul>
<li>hello</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>world</li>
</ul></p>
</blockquote>
```

```
$ marked
* hello
  > world
^D
<ul>
<li>hello<blockquote>
<p>world</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
```
