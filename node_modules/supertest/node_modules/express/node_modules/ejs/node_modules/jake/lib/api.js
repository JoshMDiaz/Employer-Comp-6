    @description Creates a Jake Task
    `
    @param {String} name The name of the Task
    @param {Array} [prereqs] Prerequisites to be run before this task
    @param {Function} [action] The action to perform for this task
    @param {Object} [opts]
      @param {Boolean} [opts.asyc=false] Perform this task asynchronously.
      If you flag a task with this option, you must call the global
      `complete` method inside the task's action, for execution to proceed
      to the next task.

    @example
    desc('This is the default task.');
    task('default', function (params) {
      console.log('This is the default task.');
    });

    desc('This task has prerequisites.');
    task('hasPrereqs', ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], function (params) {
      console.log('Ran some prereqs first.');
    })
